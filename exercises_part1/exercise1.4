First of all, we have to start a ubuntu image with a process. But we have to chose the flags
carefully because, we have to run the container in a way that in can wait for an user input.
Here is how I handle it 
    
    docker run -it ubuntu  sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; 
    read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done'

Then, if the first thing that you do after you run the container with this command, is to give him
an input, it will say that there was an error, it says this:
    "sh: 1: curl: not found"

So, we have to install it, and we will accomplish this by opening a new terminal,
in which we will run the following command so we can acces the container from it:
    
    docker exec -it <container_id> bash

To get the container_id you can use the command
    
    docker container ls

Once we are inside the container, you have to execute this commands in order to be able
to install curl:
    
    apt-get update
    apt-get-y install curl

Then if we go the other terminal we can give him any website,
and it will print the content on the terminal.
