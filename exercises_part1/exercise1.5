first we have to run the image with the new tag, we also use the flag
-d so we run it in the background, and we dont have to see all the strings
that will be printed in the console. So it's not necessary to use the flag at all.

    docker run -d devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine  

then we have to look for the container_id with this command

    docker container ls 

and last but not the least, we have to connect to the running container, and
considering that this container supports sh, because it's an alpine version,
we have to executa sh instead of bash.  
  
    docker exec -it <container_id> sh
